# Project-Devices-and-Electronic-Circuits
In this project, I focused on the design, implementation, and testing of electronic modules using discrete components such as diodes, transistors, and passive elements. I applied electrical design techniques and Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles to create and optimize circuit schematics. Additionally, I developed and designed the corresponding PCB interconnection structure, adhering to a specified technology. This project aimed to reinforce my knowledge of analog electronics and applying concepts learned in previous courses.
